            <h1>Senate Overview</h1>

            <p>The Senate Branch is composed of the Speaker's Staff, Student Senate, and joint branch Finance Commitee.</p>
            <p>The Student Senate is controlled by the Speaker of the Student Senate, and controls campus and student government policies and initiatives.</p>
            <p>The Speaker's Staff are those appointed by the Speaker of the Student Senate for various roles.</p>
            <p>
                The Student Senate is exactly as it sounds. They vote on and pass bills related to a variety of topics. 
                They must approve the creation of new branches or divisions for the highest level officers (their staff). 
                The senate is composed of senators representing the various interests of their elected colleges with seats divided by the population of the college (arts and sciences being the highest).
            </p>
            <p>This branch also has joint ownership over the Finance Commitee which controls the budget of Student Goverment as well as overall club funding.</p>
